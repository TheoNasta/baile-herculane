Workdash is a partime project born from the need of having a platform where Romanians can hire professionals that can help them in diverse areas, from packing and moving to plumbing and house renovations. As a co-founder of the project, my role is to design the interface of the product and make sure that the customer feels safe and welcomed at every step of the service journey.

The service is currently under development, you can see below a sneak peek. More information coming soon.

# Preliminary research

Our idea came as we were struggling to find trustworthy people to help with diverse tasks around the house, such as cleaning, painting, gardening, etc.. Given this, the first step of our project came naturally as we started researching ways you can find trustworthy and professional workers. 

Later, when we decided to really pursue the idea, I started doing more desk research, creating a target group and using tools such as a Market mix or Value Proposition Canvas to help up figure out the right requirements and artifacts for the platform.

# Visual Design

Our goal for the Workdash style was to provide a feeling of trust and security to its visitors, both clients and workers.

In order to pick up a color scheme, I created more options and tested then across the team and a small selection of potential users. As the opinions were spilled between 2 options, so the final result is a combination of them.
For fonts, we decided on a classic option, Roboto, for it’s known qualities on readability on the web and the Android app. For the iOS app, we will be using the San Francisco font in order to make it feel natural and save some space on the app size.
