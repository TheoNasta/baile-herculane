Each month you will receive recommendations for your pack which is uniquely made for you based or a range of different specifics such us your activity habits, age, lifestyle, geographical information and time of the year, previous experience and much more.

# Visual Design

It took a couple of variations to get to the right feeling that both I and the Induo brand were envisioning for their identity.
 
Inspired by natural ingredients used in the induo supplements, we decided to use and organic like pattern and textures of recycled paper. To adapt the brand with this change, the team decided to also change the packaging from white envelopes to recycled paper envelopes. To complement the branded induo green, I added a secondary color on the - a low saturated orange.

# Mobile first 

The current analytics Induo has more than half of their sessions are coming from mobile devices, so we opted for a mobile-first design strategy. This helped us make the most out of each content line, prioritize only the important information and stip down any unnecessary elements.
